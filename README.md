# Human Development Index Critic Overview 
#### PROBLEM Statement :
- Critic overview on the Human Development Index on Environmental Safety and Economic health

Theory:
The United Nations Development Program have set an index called the Human Development Index ‘HDI’ to masseur the development and life quality in each country on detailed attributes within three main aspects of human life: Health, Education and Income.
The importance within this index relies on the fact that it sets the role models countries for other countries to follow it polices and guidelines in order to active the same level of development as well, so the index should be reliable and well generlized.

My theory states that NOT every country that increases in it HDI will contribute positively with Environmental, personal safety and Economic health in which will make the HDI is questionable and not sufficient to make a fair or reliable judgment for the development within these countries.
Espicaly the Arabic countries in the environmental part.

**Approach:**

- **First critic overview, Environmental**
- I will take the countries with HDI increase rate between 2012 and 2017,compare it to the PM2.5 air pollution exposure.
- Exposure to PM2.5 has multiple short term and long term health impacts, A prolonged exposure to PM2.5 can cause permanent respiratory problems such as asthma, chronic bronchitis and heart disease.
Research shows that every 10ug/m3 increase in PM 2.5, increases all-cause mortality between 3-26%, chances of childhood asthma by 16%, chances of lung cancer by 36% and heart attacks by 44%.

- **Second critic overview, Personal Safety index**
- The countries that passed the first critic overview will be taken to see the rates of the personal safety percentage change within the five years.
-The personal safety index is a percentage that Mauser the scores of Homicide rate, Perceived criminality, Political killings and torture, Traffic deaths.
This index is developed by The Social Progress Imperative - Washington, DC.

- **Third critic overview,, -Economic health:**

- The countries that passed the first and second critic overview will be uptaken to see state of it debt-to-GDP percentage.

- The debt-to-GDP percentage is the metric comparing a country's public debt to its gross domestic product (GDP). By comparing what a country owes with what it produces, the debt-to-GDP ratio reliably indicates that particular country’s ability to pay back its debts.

- i will see which countries that manged to reduce the dept and then i will fetch the healthier economic one by taking the countries with less than 77% debt-to-GDP, as a study by the World Bank found that if the debt-to-GDP ratio of a country exceeds 77% for an extended period of time, it slows economic growth and puts the countries in higher economic risks.

- **Intervention:**
- intervention will be discussed with the conclusion
